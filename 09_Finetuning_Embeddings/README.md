# Week 5: Day 1 Session

In today's assignment, we'll be fine-tuning embeddings!

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  - Task 1: Dependencies and Boilerplate
  - Task 2: Loading Data
  - Task 3: Constructing a Fine-tuning Dataset
  - Task 4: Fine-tuning `snowflake-arctic-embed-l`
  - Task 5: Evaluating our Retriever

## Ship 🚢

The completed notebook!

#### 🏗️ BONUS ACTIVITY (FULL MARKS IF COMPLETED IN LIEU OF ABOVE NOTEBOOK):

Using your own source data (from multiple sources) fine-tune an embedding model by synthetically generating 100 question/context using the Ragas Knowledge Graph Approach.

Compare and contrast this model to a model fine-tuned using the naive approach found in the notebook. 

> NOTE: You can use any embedding model and fine-tuning framework that you desire!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of the notebook, and a 1min. walkthrough of the application in full
